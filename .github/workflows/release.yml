# OIDC Trusted Publishing Configuration:
# - No NPM_TOKEN required - using OpenID Connect for npm authentication
# - Requires: id-token: write permission (line 17)
# - Requires: semantic-release v25+ with @semantic-release/npm v13+
# - Requires: provenance: true in .releaserc.json
# - Package must be linked on npmjs.com (Package Settings → Manage Publishing Access)
# - See: https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/
