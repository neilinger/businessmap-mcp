# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete CRUD Operations for MCP Resources

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Exactly 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (P2, P3, P4 only - P1 fully specified)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Hybrid approach validated (P1 ready, P2-P4 require research)

### Content Quality Assessment

- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT users need (CRUD operations completion) and WHY (close gaps, improve coverage). P1 references existing file locations as facts, not implementation plans.
- **User value focused**: All user stories articulate clear value propositions with realistic effort estimates (P1: 2-4 hours for 5 existing operations).
- **Non-technical language**: Written for business stakeholders with plain language descriptions. Technical terms (workspaces, boards, cards) are BusinessMap domain concepts, not implementation details.
- **All mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, and Dependencies all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment - Hybrid Approach

- **Exactly 3 clarification markers**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers strategically placed in P2, P3, P4 only. P1 is fully specified with concrete file locations.
  - P2 (line 39): "Which comment/outcome/subtask operations does BusinessMap API v2 support?"
  - P3 (line 58): "Does BusinessMap API v2 support workflow/column CRUD operations?"
  - P4 (line 77): "Does BusinessMap API v2 support custom field CRUD operations?"
- **Testable requirements**: All 20 functional requirements use concrete, verifiable language. FR-001/FR-002 reference specific files. FR-003+ marked "*(Subject to API capability verification)*".
- **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (percentages, timeframes, counts). Examples: "within 5 seconds", "100% of existing client-layer operations", "90% coverage".
- **Technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (e.g., "Users can update... within 5 seconds") rather than technical internals (e.g., "API response time").
- **Acceptance scenarios**: Each of 4 user stories includes 3-4 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy paths and key interactions.
- **Edge cases**: 7 edge cases identified covering critical scenarios (cascading deletes, concurrent updates, referential integrity).
- **Scope boundaries**: Clear In Scope (8 items) and Out of Scope (8 items) sections define feature boundaries explicitly.
- **Dependencies and assumptions**: 10 explicit assumptions documented, 6 dependencies listed with specifics.

### Feature Readiness Assessment - Phased Approach

- **P1 immediately implementable**: 5 existing client methods with exact file locations (workspace-client.ts:33, board-client.ts:64, etc.). Zero API questions. Estimated 2-4 hours.
- **P2-P4 research required**: Each has single targeted clarification question about API capabilities. Research can proceed in parallel with P1 implementation.
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: All functional requirements link to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Requirements are independently verifiable.
- **Primary flows covered**: 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover the feature scope systematically: quick wins (P1), card management (P2), workflows (P3), custom fields (P4).
- **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria provide concrete targets for each priority area (e.g., SC-003 for P1, SC-004 for P2, SC-005 for P3, SC-006 for P4).
- **Separation of concerns**: P1 facts vs P2-P4 unknowns clearly delineated. FR-001/FR-002 concrete, FR-003+ subject to verification.

## Notes

- **Strengths**: Specification leverages existing gap analysis (CRUD_GAP_ANALYSIS.md) to provide precise, data-driven requirements. Priority structure aligns with quick wins strategy. Hybrid approach separates known facts (P1) from unknowns (P2-P4).
- **Documentation trail**: Feature builds on comprehensive analysis artifacts (CRUD_ANALYSIS_INDEX.md, CRUD_MATRIX.csv, IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md). VALIDATION.md documents hybrid approach rationale.
- **Phased implementation strategy**:
  - **P1 ready**: Can proceed to `/speckit.plan` immediately for 5 existing operations (2-4 hours)
  - **P2-P4 research**: Requires API capability verification before planning. 3 targeted questions documented.
- **Implementation recommendation**: Start P1 (immediate value) while conducting parallel API research for P2-P4. Update spec with findings before proceeding to later phases.
- **Quality validated**: All mandatory sections complete, requirements testable, success criteria measurable, scope clearly bounded. Hybrid approach maintains spec quality while acknowledging unknowns.
