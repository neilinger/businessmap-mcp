# Spec Validation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Spec Version**: Updated with hybrid approach

## Update Summary

Successfully updated `/Users/neil/src/solo/businessmap-mcp/specs/001-complete-crud-operations/spec.md` with hybrid approach:

### Changes Applied

#### P1 Updates (Known Facts)
✅ Changed language from "implementing" to "exposing existing client methods"
✅ Listed 5 operations with exact file locations:
- `update_workspace` (workspace-client.ts:33)
- `delete_workspace` (workspace-client.ts:48)
- `update_board` (board-client.ts:64)
- `delete_board` (board-client.ts:73)
- `delete_card` (card-client.ts:167)

✅ Updated effort estimate from "~1.5 hours" to "2-4 hours"
✅ Maintained business language throughout (no technical jargon in user stories)

#### P2-P4 Updates (Unknowns)
✅ Added single [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] per story:
- P2 (line 39): "Which comment/outcome/subtask operations does BusinessMap API v2 support?"
- P3 (line 58): "Does BusinessMap API v2 support workflow/column CRUD operations?"
- P4 (line 77): "Does BusinessMap API v2 support custom field CRUD operations?"

✅ Total [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] count: **3** (meets ≤ 3 requirement)

#### FR Updates
✅ FR-001 & FR-002: Updated to reference specific file locations and existing methods
✅ FR-003 through FR-014: Added note "*(Subject to API capability verification)*"
✅ FR-015 through FR-020: Unchanged (general requirements)

### User Story Quality (P1)
- [x] Business language used (no technical jargon)
- [x] Clear "Why this priority" rationale
- [x] Independent test criteria defined
- [x] Concrete file locations listed
- [x] Realistic effort estimate (2-4 hours)
- [x] 3 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format

### User Story Quality (P2-P4)
- [x] Business language maintained
- [x] Each has single targeted [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- [x] Independent test criteria defined
- [x] 3-4 acceptance scenarios each
- [x] Priority rationale explained

### Functional Requirements Quality
- [x] FR-001 & FR-002: Reference concrete implementations
- [x] FR-003+: Clearly marked as subject to verification
- [x] All FRs maintain MUST language
- [x] Numbered sequentially (FR-001 through FR-020)
- [x] Cross-references maintained

### Clarification Management
- [x] Total [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] = 3 (within limit)
- [x] Each clarification is targeted and actionable
- [x] Clarifications focus on API capabilities, not implementation
- [x] No redundant or overlapping clarifications

### Language & Tone
- [x] P1 uses business language (resources, lifecycle, structures)
- [x] No premature technical details in user stories
- [x] Acceptance scenarios focus on business outcomes
- [x] Technical details confined to FR section where appropriate

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Available
1. **Implement P1** (2-4 hours): Expose 5 existing operations as MCP tools
   - All client methods confirmed to exist
   - Zero API capability questions
   - Can start implementation immediately

### Research Required Before P2-P4
1. **API Capability Discovery** for P2:
   - Review BusinessMap API v2 docs for comment operations
   - Review outcome management endpoints
   - Review subtask CRUD operations

2. **API Capability Discovery** for P3:
   - Review workflow creation/update/delete endpoints
   - Review column management operations

3. **API Capability Discovery** for P4:
   - Review custom field CRUD endpoints
   - Review field type definitions and constraints

### Recommended Workflow
1. Start P1 implementation (no blockers)
2. Parallel API research for P2-P4
3. Update spec with API findings
4. Proceed with P2-P4 implementation based on verified capabilities

## Quality Metrics

- **Clarity Score**: High - P1 has concrete file paths, P2-P4 have targeted questions
- **Actionability**: High - P1 ready for implementation, P2-P4 have clear research paths
- **Completeness**: Good - All mandatory sections present, 3 focused clarifications
- **Maintainability**: Good - Clear separation between known (P1) and unknown (P2-P4)
- **Realism**: High - Effort estimates updated, capabilities explicitly questioned
