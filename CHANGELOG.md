#### Claude Code Skills (Issue #10)

**Interactive API Guidance Skills**
- `businessmap-consultant` - Interactive workflow guidance for board setup, card migrations, and bulk operations
- `businessmap-troubleshooting` - Error diagnosis and resolution for API errors (403, 404, 429, BS05)
- `businessmap-best-practices` - Performance optimization, rate limiting strategies, and production patterns

### Changed

#### Token Optimization (Issue #10)

**MCP Tool Description Refactoring**
- Reduced all 58 tool descriptions from verbose (avg 9.1 words) to concise (avg 2.5 words)
- **Token savings**: ~385 tokens per MCP connection (~73% reduction)
- **Improved efficiency**: Moved detailed usage patterns from tool descriptions to Claude Code skills
- Maintained full functionality and clarity while optimizing for token usage

**Before**: "Get a list of boards with optional filters" (8 words)
**After**: "List boards" (2 words) âœ…

- `bulk_update_boards` - Update multiple boards in single transaction
- `bulk_delete_cards` - Delete multiple cards with consolidated confirmation
- `bulk_update_cards` - Update multiple cards in single transaction

**Infrastructure Improvements**
- Dependency analysis service for cascade delete operations
- Consolidated confirmation builder with hierarchical dependency tree display
- Enhanced error messages with FR-016 compliance:
  - Specific failure cause identification
  - Transient vs permanent error classification
  - Actionable remediation steps for all error scenarios
- Rate limit handling with automatic retry logic and exponential backoff
- Read-only mode support for all new write operations

### Changed

- CRUD coverage increased from ~50% to ~80% (+30 percentage points)
- Total tool count increased from 43 to 65 tools (+22 new tools)
- Delete operations now include cascade dependency analysis and confirmation prompts
- Bulk operations support up to 50 resources per request with detailed per-resource status reporting
- Custom Field Management expanded from 1 tool to 7 tools (full CRUD support)
- Tool categories expanded from 7 to 9 with new Bulk Operations category

### Technical Details

- All new tools respect `BUSINESSMAP_READ_ONLY_MODE` environment variable
- Cascade delete confirmations follow formats defined in `contracts/CONFIRMATION_EXAMPLES.md`
- Error handling includes transient/permanent classification per FR-016 specification
- Custom field deletion includes pre-delete dependency analysis showing affected boards and cards
- Bulk operations provide consolidated confirmations grouping resources by dependency status
- Rate limit detection via HTTP 429 responses and `X-RateLimit-*` headers

### Performance
